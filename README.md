# Hide the digits of given string, except last 4 digits

## Training with katas from codewars

As the title explains, this kata requires the developer to hide the digits of a credit card
number, except the last 4 digits.

A set of test cases is provided as a guide to a better, more robust implementation of the solution.

_@andorey_'s solution is my favourite and you can compare its elegance and brevity
against the length of my solution. His uses `slice` and `padStart`, two methods
that are exactly meant to solve a problem like this one at hand!

## how to run the tests

\> npm install

\> npm test

This will run test cases on both mine and _andorey_'s implementation of the solution
to the aforementioned problem.
